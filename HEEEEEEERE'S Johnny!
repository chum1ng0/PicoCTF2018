Okay, so we found some important looking files on a linux computer. 
Maybe they can be used to get a password to the process.
Connect with nc 2018shell.picoctf.com 5221. 
Files can be found here: passwd shadow.

-user command unshadow passwd shadow > crack.txt
- john --wordlist='/usr/share/wordlists/rockyou.txt crack.txt
- password1
- Go  nc 2018shell.picoctf.com 5221
- username: root , password: password1, enter this flag...
flag= picoCTF{J0hn_1$_R1pp3d_289677b5}
